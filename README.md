# DistributionListAutomation
The Distribution List Automation System streamlines the management of email distribution lists (DLs) across an organization. Manual DL management is time-consuming, error-prone, and hard to scale in large enterprises. This system automates DL creation, updates, and membership changes, ensuring accuracy, compliance, and efficiency.
